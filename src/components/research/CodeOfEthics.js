        <p>
          Research at SPSU is expected to be designed and carried out in a way
          that ensures high standards of quality &amp; integrity by researchers &amp;
          research groups. Further, all research should strive to contribute to
          the enhancement of knowledge and understanding. Poorly
          designed/conducted research wastes resources and could even lead to
          flawed conclusions with the potential to cause harm. To minimize such
          possibilities, the SPSU Code of Ethics for Research has been developed
          on the foundations of four key elements:
        </p>
        <p>
          <ul>
            <li>Integrity</li>
            <li>
              Respect for all stakeholders including those participating in
              research
            </li>
            <li>Responsibility</li>
            <li>Competence</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>These ethical principles are briefly described below:</p>
        <p>
          <br/>
          <h5 className="heading">Integrity</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          Research at SPSU shall conform to the highest standards of integrity.
          This includes, but is not limited to, conformance to the law of the
          land, meeting IPR requirements and eschewing plagiarism in all
          research taken up at SPSU. Our researchers shall conduct research in a
          manner consistent with the needs of honest, open enquiry. Researchers
          shall clearly communicate their findings accurately without
          suppressing disconfirming findings, besides separating findings from
          opinions and ideas. Further, ideas used in research will be duly
          acknowledged and publication credit given as appropriate. Thus, all
          research at SPSU shall eschew piracy of research findings besides
          ensuring that plagiarism is avoided. Researchers at SPSU will also
          make all efforts to avoid conflict of interests in their research and
          where unavoidable, steps will be taken to safeguard interests of stake
          holders.
        </p>
        <p>
        <br/>
          <h5 className="heading">
            Respect for all stakeholders including those participating in
            research
          </h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          All research at SPSU will be carried out in a manner consistent with
          the highest standards of environmental responsibility and concern for
          all life. This requires that all research at SPSU built on respect for
          the rights of society as a key stakeholder as well as concern for the
          well-being of research participants &amp; experimental animals. Concern
          for environment will be demonstrated through a conscious effort to
          minimize polluting land, water or atmosphere on account of research
          carried out. All research must be carried out through use of
          environmentally responsible practices. Researchers will follow a
          systematic methodology to identify, manage, reduce and dispose-off
          environmentally hazardous/toxic substances and waste in a safe manner.
          Where possible, environmentally hazardous/toxic material shall be
          recycled to minimize consumption of such material and possibility of
          harm caused. Where material used or waste produced is
          non-hazardous/non-toxic, researchers will systematically identify,
          manage, reduce &amp; recycle the material. In cases where recycling is not
          possible, the waste will be dispose-off in an environmentally safe
          manner. Respect for rights of society as a key stakeholder &amp;
          well-being of research participants shall include respect to their
          privacy, confidentiality, self-determination and autonomy. Research
          that involves use of animals or genetic material from microbes, plants
          and animals shall be carried out as per the regulations and guidelines
          of regulatory authorities in the country. SPSU requires that
          meticulous records be maintained for all such research so that
          management/authorities can examine these and find improved ways of
          conducting research. Further, all research shall be consistent with
          the law of the land. The research process at SPSU is cognizant of
          diverse populations and allows for the protection of vulnerable
          groups. Respect for privacy shall include being sensitive to the
          personal as well as culturally defined private space of stake holders
          and research participants so as to avoid infringing upon the same.
          Further, the research would focus on collecting only such
          data/information that is germane to the purpose of research undertaken
          and protecting their confidentiality after the data is collected.
        </p>
        <p>
        <br/>
          <h5 className="heading">Responsibility</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          Researchers at SPSU shall be aware of their professional
          responsibilities while undertaking research and shall avoid harming
          stakeholders and research participants. These professional
          responsibilities shall include: (a) sensitivity to the current
          problems of society when framing research objectives and questions;
          (b) sensitivity to the need to protect dignity &amp; well-being of
          research participants at all times; (c) avoid engaging in research
          that impacts the research participants personality or their
          mental/physical well-being; and (d) report results on vulnerable
          groups with great care to minimize misuse or misinterpretation of
          research findings.
        </p>
        <p>
        <br/>
          <h5 className="heading">Competence</h5>
        </p>
        <p>
          All researchers at SPSU shall strive to ensure and maintain high
          standards of competence in their work with limitations of expertise
          and competence being recognized clearly where relevant. Faculty at
          SPSU shall, therefore, only engage in research that they are qualified
          to take up. In cases where such qualification is lacking or found
          insufficient, guidance of experts will be formally sought and research
          carried out under such guidance. Further, faculty &amp; researchers at
          SPSU shall strive to upgrade themselves continuously so that their
          research takes up contemporary issues and challenges faced by society.
          This Code will be reviewed periodically to ensure its continued
          relevance &amp; effectiveness in ensuring that research at SPSU conforms
          to the highest standards of rigour, integrity &amp; excellence and
          strengthened further where required.

          OVERVIEW
        </h5>
        <p className="general-desc">
          Mechanical Engineering Deals with Designing &amp; Manufacturing of small
          individual parts &amp; devices (e.g. micro scale sensors &amp; inkjet printer
          nozzles) to large systems (e.g. spacecraft &amp; machine tools). The role
          of a mechanical engineer is to transform an idea into a product having
          practical &amp; commercial utility. The mechanical engineer needs to
          acquire specific skills &amp; knowledge to accomplish the desired goals.
          The one skill that is a mechanical engineerâ€™s exclusive domain is the
          ability to analyze &amp; design objects &amp; systems with motion. Mechanical
          engineers play a central role in such industries as automotive (car
          chassis &amp; its subsystems-engine, transmission, sensors); aerospace
          (airplanes, aircraft engines, control systems for airplanes &amp; 
          spacecraft); biotechnology (implants, prosthetic devices, fluidics
          systems for pharmaceutical industries); computers &amp; electronics (disk
          drives, printers, cooling systems, semiconductor tools); micro
          electromechanical systems(MEMS) (sensors, actuators, micro power
          generation); energy conversion (gas turbines, wind turbines, solar
          energy, fuel cells); environmental control (HVAC, air-conditioning,
          refrigeration, compressors); automation (robots, data &amp; image
          acquisition, recognition, control) &amp; manufacturing (machining, machine
          tools, prototyping, micro fabrication).

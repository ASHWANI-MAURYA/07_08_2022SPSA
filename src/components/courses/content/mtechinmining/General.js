          OVERVIEW
        </h5>
        <p className="general-desc">
          Mining Engineering is the science of extraction and exemption of
          essential natural minerals from the environment. A mining Engineer
          learns the skill and theory of mineral extraction without making any
          damage to the environment where the extraction activity takes place.
          Mining engineers are not only supposed to extract and process minerals,&nbsp; 
          but it is needed of them to do the same in a responsible manner.
          <p>Strength of a building depends on its foundation strength. Same is
          true for mining as well. As the foundation of all mining activity – a
          mine plan – most accurately reflects the real-time reality of the
          geological structure in the ground. Mine Planning can be defined as
          the process of optimizing the exploitation of mineral reserves for
          maximum added value aligned with the strategic goals and objectives of
          the business enterprise.</p><p>The department offers M. Tech degree
          programme with specialisation in Mine Planning and Mine Environment
          with an integrated approach by incorporating contemporary syllabus in
          both theory &amp; practical.</p><p>After completing a course in M. Tech Mining
          Engineering, the candidates can opt for various career opportunities
          and job prospects like they can go for either a government-based or a
          private based Mining Corporation. The various job options available
          after pursuing a degree in M. Tech Mining Engineering includes Mining
          Engineer in mines, Central Mine Planner, Researcher, Technical Mining
          consultant, Technical Scientist, etc.</p>
